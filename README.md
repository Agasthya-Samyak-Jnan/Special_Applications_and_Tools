Hi!
This contains all of my programs where i attempt to build an useful application using C, C++, Java, or Python mostly. I would encourage your suggestions and ideas or any new concept that 
you would like me take a shot at. I am a beginner still learning to build full applications with GUI (Graphical User Interface) and Logic (Data Structures and Algorithms backend) and 
Static/Dynamic linked Libraries etc.
